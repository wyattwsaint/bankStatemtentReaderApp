SPECIAL RULE FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES 
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE QUALITY OF GOODS OR SERVICES THAT YOU PURCHASED WITH A CREDIT 
CARD, AND YOU HAVE TRIED IN GOOD FAITH TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITH THE MERCHANT, YOU MAY NOT 
HAVE TO PAY THE REMAINING AMOUNT DUE ON THE GOODS OR SERVICES. YOU HAVE THIS PROTECTION 
ONLY WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS MORE THAN $50 AND THE PURCHASE WAS MADE IN YOUR HOME 
STATE OR WITHIN 100 MILES OF YOUR MAILING ADDRESS. (IF WE OWN OR OPERATE THE MERCHANT, OR IF WE  
MAILED YOU THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE PROPERTY OR SERVICES, ALL PURCHASES ARE COVERED 
REGARDLESS OF AMOUNT OR LOCATION OF PURCHASE.) 
FINANCE CHARGES - BALANCE COMPUTATION  
HOME EQUITY LOANS: FINANCE CHARGES BEGIN TO ACCRUE IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE MAKE AN 
ADVANCE TO YOU. FINANCE CHARGES WILL BE COMPUTED AS FOLLOWS: TO FIGURE THE FINANCE CHARGE 
FOR EACH DAY IN A BILLING CYCLE, WE MULTIPLY THE DAILY PERIODIC RATE BY THE DAILY BALANCE OF YOUR 
LOAN ACCOUNT BALANCE ON THAT DAY. WE THEN ADD UP THOSE DAILY FINANCE CHARGES TO FIGURE THE 
TOTAL FINANCE CHARGE FOR THAT BILLING CYCLE. TO FIGURE THE DAILY BALANCE, WE FIRST TAKE YOUR LOAN 
ACCOUNT BALANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH DAY, ADD ANY NEW ADVANCES, AND SUBTRACT ANY 
PAYMENTS OR CREDITS THAT APPLY TO DEBT REPAYMENT, AND ANY UNPAID FINANCE CHARGES, FEES AND 
CHARGES. THIS GIVES US THE DAILY BALANCE.  
PERSONAL SERVICE LOANS: THE DOLLAR AMOUNT YOU PAY FOR MONEY BORROWED IS CALLED A "FINANCE 
CHARGE" AND BEGINS ON THE DATE OF EACH ADVANCE. A FINANCE CHARGE WILL BE COMPUTED 
SEPARATELY FOR EACH SEPARATE BALANCE UNDER THE PLAN. TO COMPUTE THE FINANCE CHARGE, THE 
UNPAID BALANCE FOR EACH DAY SINCE YOUR LAST PAYMENT (OR SINCE AN ADVANCE IF YOU HAVE NOT YET 
MADE A PAYMENT) IS MULTIPLIED BY THE APPLICABLE DAILY PERIODIC RATE. THE SUM OF THESE AMOUNTS 
IS THE FINANCE CHARGE OWED. THE BALANCE USED TO COMPUTE THE FINANCE CHARGE IS THE UNPAID 
BALANCE EACH DAY AFTER PAYMENTS AND CREDITS TO THAT BALANCE HAVE BEEN SUBTRACTED AND ANY 
ADDITIONS TO THE BALANCE HAVE BEEN MADE. 
VISA® LOANS:  
INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES: WE WILL BEGIN CHARGING YOU INTEREST ON PURCHASES ON THE 
DATE THE TRANSACTION IS POSTED TO YOUR ACCOUNT. WE WILL BEGIN CHARGING YOU INTEREST ON CASH 
ADVANCES AND BALANCE TRANSFERS ON THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION. HOWEVER, WE WILL NOT CHARGE 
YOU ANY INTEREST ON NEW PURCHASES IF YOUR ACCOUNT HAD A ZERO OR CREDIT BALANCE AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THAT BILLING CYCLE, OR YOU PAID THE ENTIRE NEW BALANCE ON THE PREVIOUS CYCLE'S 
BILLING STATEMENT BY THE PAYMENT DUE DATE OF THAT STATEMENT. TO AVOID AN ADDITIONAL FINANCE 
CHARGE ON THE BALANCE OF PURCHASES, YOU MUST PAY THE ENTIRE NEW BALANCE ON THE BILLING 
STATEMENT BY THE PAYMENT DUE DATE OF THAT STATEMENT. 
HOW WE CALCULATE YOUR BALANCE: INTEREST CHARGES ON YOUR ACCOUNT ARE CALCULATED 
SEPARATELY FOR PURCHASES, BALANCE TRANSFERS AND CASH ADVANCES (“TRANSACTION TYPE”). WE 
FIGURE THE INTEREST CHARGE FOR EACH TRANSACTION TYPE BY APPLYING THE PERIODIC RATE TO EACH 
CORRESPONDING “AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE.” TO GET THE “AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE” FOR A TRANSACTION 
TYPE WE TAKE THE BEGINNING BALANCE FOR THAT TRANSACTION TYPE EACH DAY, ADD ANY NEW 
TRANSACTIONS OF THAT TYPE, AND SUBTRACT ANY UNPAID INTEREST OR OTHER FINANCE CHARGES AND ANY 
APPLICABLE PAYMENTS OR CREDITS. THIS GIVES US THE DAILY BALANCE FOR EACH TRANSACTION TYPE. 
THEN, FOR EACH TRANSACTION TYPE, WE ADD UP ALL THE DAILY BALANCES FOR THE BILLING CYCLE AND 
DIVIDE EACH TOTAL BY THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN THE BILLING CYCLE. THIS GIVES US THE “AVERAGE DAILY 
BALANCE” FOR EACH TRANSACTION TYPE. 
ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION: MATERIAL CONTAINED IN THE PAYMENT INFORMATION TABLE IS 
PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED UPON YOUR ACCOUNT 
ACTIVITY. A CREDIT BALANCE REMAINING ON YOUR VISA ACCOUNT LONGER THAN 60 DAYS WILL BE 
TRANSFERRED TO YOUR REGULAR SHARE ACCOUNT.
